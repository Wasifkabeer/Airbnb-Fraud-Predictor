I created a prediction model in which uses a dataset containing airbnb bookings from the Boston area and whether said booking was fraud. I trained the model to understand the dataset to then predict whether the booking would be fraud. This project can be found in the Jupyter Notebook I have uploaded titled "Final Project"
